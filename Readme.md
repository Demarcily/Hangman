Started project and connected to github

Remembering how to code due to break and trying to understand 
how do check individual letters of a word

* 2021-01-19

Made a counter, and a checker to check if 
the word is true or not, however, the checker is unable to 
check individual letters, and I haven't set up a file or array
to randomize letters

Will most likely use a Math.Random to take a random string
from an array or list

I will also need to check how I can separate things into
different methods

Didn't get anything done unfortunately

* 2021-01-29

Nearly impossible to focus and I was trying to get methods to work
but I don't understand them very well.

I will watch some yt videos on my free time.

Made a method for picking a random word from a file and
connected it to the main method, but I have a feeling I could've done it
better
